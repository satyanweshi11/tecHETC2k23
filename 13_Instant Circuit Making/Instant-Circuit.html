            <h2 class="about">About Instant Circuit Making</h2>
            <p>An electronic circuit is composed of individual electronic components, such as resistors, transistors, capacitors, inductors and diodes, connected by conductive wires or traces through which electric current can flow.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Rules:</h3>
            <p> 1.	The decision of the judges will be final. <br>
                2.	Proof of identity must be produced (college ID/library card/certification from college authority). <br>
                3.	Only scientific calculators are allowed (Casio - 82MS) [programmable calculators, mobile phones, iPods and other electronic gadgets are not allowed]. <br>
                4.	If the circuit burns out or any equipment used by the group gets damaged, that group will be disqualified immediately. <br>
                5.	Candidates must bring id proof, event registration form, calculator and pen only. The event organizing authority will provide sheets of paper, circuit elements, wires and everything needed. <br> <br>
                
                <strong>Time required for the event: </strong> <br>
                Expected events running time = 10+15+30 = 55 minutes <br>
                Time expected in transition = 10+10+10+10=40 minutes <br>
                Total time = 1 hour 35 minutes <br> <br>
                <strong> 1st Round – Basic Circuit making(Analog or Digital): </strong> <br> <br>
                Time = 15minutes. <br> <br>
                6 groups will be selected from this round based on the proper operation of the circuit and how fast it has been made within the time limit mentioned. <br>
                Students have to choose the required elements themselves. <br> <br>
                <strong>Final round:</strong> <br>
                A critical circuit has to be made using the least number of elements and with the highest simplicity. <br>
                Domain:-Power Electronics and Control Based Circuit. <br>
                For both rounds, circuits must be chosen on a lottery basis only. <br> <br>
                <strong>Time – </strong> 30mins <br> <br>
                Three groups will be declared to be the champion, first runner-up, and second runner-up, respectively, based on the proper operation of the circuit and how fast it has been made within the time limit mentioned. <br>
                A tie-breaker may choose the champion and runner-up if two or more groups score the same point. <br>

                </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Team Details:</h3>
            <p>Instant Circuit Making is an Individual Event. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Eligibility:</h3>
            <p>All Participants must produce proper College ID card, and should be able to produce the same in original when asked for verification, failing which they will not be allowed to participate. Each participant should be a student pursuing some field of study in college/university.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Registration Fees:</h3>
            <p>The one-time registration fee for each candidate is Rs.100/- .</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Co-ordinator:</h3>
            <p>Prof. Anikendu Maitra (+91 9874305070)
