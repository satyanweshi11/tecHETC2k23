        <h3>Event Details:</h3>
        <p>
          A maximum of 80 participants will be allowed in the event on a
          first-come-first-serve basis. <br />
          The contestants will be given 30 minutes to solve the paper. <br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Rules:</h3>
        <p>
          1. The three winners of the contest will be decided based on the
          following parameters:<br />
          a) The contestants who come up with the correct solution the
          quickest.<br />
          b) If two or more contestants solve the question paper correctly
          simultaneously, another question paper will be provided as a
          tie-breaker. The maximum time allotted to solve that paper will be 10
          minutes.<br />
          c) In case none of the contestants is able to solve the paper in the
          given time, the difference between the correct and incorrect entries
          will be calculated ( +1 for each correct entry, -1/2 for each
          incorrect one), and the contestant with the highest positive score
          will be declared the winner. If more than one participant has the
          highest positive score, the tie-breaker option will be availed. The
          rules mentioned in (b) will apply to the tie-breaker round.<br />
          2. Any disruptive or disorderly conduct from a participant will result
          in his/her immediate disqualification from the event.<br />
          3. In case of any conflict/controversy, the decision of the evaluators
          will be considered final and absolute.<br />
          4. <b>Use black/blue ball-point pen only.</b><br />
